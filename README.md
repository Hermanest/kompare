# What is Kompare

Kompare is a simple image comparison software written in Kotlin. It uses Jetpack Compose as a UI framework, so it can be easily launched on any platform. 
With the help of OpenCV, Kompare quickly finds duplicate or similar images, helping you organize your photo collection and get rid of unnecessary duplicates.
Whether youâ€™re cleaning up personal photos or managing a larger collection, Kompare makes it simple to spot and remove similar images with just a few clicks.
